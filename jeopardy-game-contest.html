<p class="p2">
This project uses reactable and scss to create a board from the game Jeopardy! <em><strong>Hovering</strong></em> over a card will cause it to flip and reveal the clue for that category and value. The answer to each clue may be also viewed on the back of each card.
</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h2>
<p class="p2">
Below is a faithful recreation of the game board presented in round 1 on Sept 20, 2019. It was created programmatically from data retrieved using the <a href="https://github.com/kiernann/whatr">whatr</a> package.
